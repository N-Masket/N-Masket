## Hi there , I'm Nyasha 👋

I’m a Software Engineering student **building in public**.  
I turn ideas into small, intentional projects while documenting every step of my learning journey.

---

## 🚀 What I Do
- Build projects that solve real problems  
- Apply coding best practices  
- Share progress, lessons, and insights publicly

---

## 📂 Here You’ll Find
- Coursework & personal projects  
- Experiments & prototypes  
- Projects that reflect **growth over perfection**
- A few “oops, what was I thinking?” moments (hey, we all have them 😅)  
- And occasionally, a tiny surprise that makes you smile
---

## 💡 My Philosophy
I believe in **learning by doing** and **progress over perfection**.  
Every repo is a milestone — some are complete, some are evolving, all are intentional.
